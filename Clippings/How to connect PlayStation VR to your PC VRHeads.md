# How to connect PlayStation VR to your PC | VRHeads
[How to connect PlayStation VR to your PC | VRHeads](https://www.vrheads.com/how-play-steam-games-playstation-vr) 

 Sony's entry into the virtual reality world has so far been a hit — their head-mounted display is as comfortable as they get, and the library of quality games continues to grow. For some of you, however, [PlayStation VR](https://www.vrheads.com/playstation-vr) games might not be enough. Thanks to some clever programming by the developers at Odd Sheep Games, you can actually connect your PSVR to your PC. Trinus PSVR is a piece of software that handles all the communication between your PC and PSVR that would normally never happen.

Why would you want to connect your PSVR to anything other than a PS4? If you have a library of Steam games on your PC, whether VR or not, you can play them with Trinus PSVR. If you'd like to watch movies or TV in VR, you can also do so through the PSVR head-mounted display.

If this is something you've always wanted to do, we're here to show you how to get it all set up.

27.  Hit **Windows key + Shift + Right arrow** on your keyboard to move the headset display over to the **PSVR**. If you put on your PSVR, you'll be able to see everything just as though you were wearing a Rift or Vive.

You can now launch a SteamVR game and enjoy it in PSVR. To get your keyboard and mouse or controller to work in the game, use the **Alt + Tab** shortcut on your keyboard to bring up the actual game window on your standard monitor.

Mouse mode
----------

If you'd like to play _all_ of your Steam games in PSVR, you can do so with Mouse mode. Some games, like Crysis 3 and Doom 3, come with built-in side-by-side support that let you play as you normally would in VR, but most games don't have this type of support unless you use something like [VorpX](https://www.vrheads.com/using-vorpx-play-non-vr-games-vr).

In the case of standard games, you can still enjoy them in cinematic mode within your PSVR.

1.  Click the **Main** tab at the top of the **Trinus PSVR** window.
2.  Click the **dropdown arrow** next to **PC Mode**.
    
    [![](https://github.com/ustczzh/MyClippings/blob/main/Images/2022-12-20%2019-13-49/2994f2dd-5b38-4578-9c14-56495f333e3e.jpeg?raw=true)

6.  Click the **dropdown arrow** next to **PSVR Mode**.

9.  Launch a **non-VR Steam game**.

The same headset window with a split view should be moved over to your PSVR by hitting **Windows key + Shift + Right arrow** on your keyboard until it leaves your standard monitor.

Instead of leaving the actual game window on your standard monitor, you want to also move it over to the PSVR by hitting **Windows key + Shift + Right arrow** on your keyboard. Once you've moved it over to the PSVR, you'll see the game appear on large screen in front of you. You can now enjoy all your non-VR games in cinematic mode in PSVR.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Trinus PSVR is a work in progress, so there are understandably a few bugs. Here are a few fixes to some common problems.

### Tracking and drift problems

When you first click Start in Trinus PSVR, ensure your head-mounted display is placed on a steady surface and is pointing toward the direction you're facing. If you don't have the PSVR on a steady surface when you first launch, it will track all over the place and you'll have a frustrating time trying to get your cursor into the right place.

### Adjust the clarity of the PSVR's picture

Looking at a blurry image in VR is not fun at all. If you find that adjusting the physical headset isn't fixing things, Trinus PSVR has an IPD slider built in that allows you to adjust the picture.

1.  Launch **Trinus PSVR** from your Start menu, desktop, or taskbar.
2.  Click the **Main** tab.
3.  Click and drag the **slider** in the **IPD** section. You'll likely want to half hold the PSVR over your eyes in order to see the changes. Adjust it as you see fit until the picture clears up.
